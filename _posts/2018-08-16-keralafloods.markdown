title: Kerala Flood Collection Drive
subtitle: Emergency Collection
description: "The ﬂooding of Kerala during this monsoon was a national disaster and an event of wreckage and destruction for many within the state. People were stranded, devoid of food and water. Many were housed within the disaster relief camps set up during the ﬂoods. With the mass destruction of the state and lack of resources, food and clothing was scarce and such resources were to be procured and delivered from the neighbouring states.
With that crisis scenario in Kerala, Rotaract Club - NITK Chapter with the backing of the NITK Student Council raised money from the students and staﬀ of NITK to support the aﬄicted. The money was  raised with the help of the many generous minds who volunteered to support the cause. The collection took place on the 16th August 2018 and within the span of 5 hours, we were able to raise a huge amount of ₹2,81,006/-
A portion of the money raised was given to the NITK Student Council for their relief activities in Kodagu under the supervision of the Director, NITK.Also, with the recent occurrence of ﬂoods in Nagaland, a small amount of the collected money was sent to the Distress Relief Fund of Nagaland. This relief effort by the Rotaract Club has hopefully helped out thousands of those stranded in a tough situation and thanks to the generosity of the students of NITK helped make a real change in the world."
